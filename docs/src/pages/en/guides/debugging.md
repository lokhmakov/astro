Astro runs on the server and logs directly to your terminal, so it can be difficult to debug values from Astro. Astro's built-in `<Debug>` component can help you inspect values inside your files on the clientside. Read more about the [built-in Debug Component](/en/reference/builtin-components#debug-).
