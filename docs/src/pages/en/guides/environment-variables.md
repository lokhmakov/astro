description: Learn how to use environment variables in an Astro project.

Astro uses Vite for environment variables, and allows you to use any of its methods to get and set environment variables. Note that all environment variables must be prefixed with `PUBLIC_` to be accessible by client side code.

The ability to access private variables on the server side is [still being discussed](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/1765).

## Setting environment variables

Vite includes `dotenv` by default, allowing you to easily set environment variables without any extra configuration in Astro projects. You can also attach a mode (either `production` or `development`) to the filename, like `.env.production` or `.env.development`, which makes the environment variables only take effect in that mode.

Just create a `.env` file in the project directory and add some variables to it.

```bash
# .env
PUBLIC_POKEAPI="https://pokeapi.co/api/v2"
```

## Getting environment variables

Instead of using `process.env`, with Vite you use `import.meta.env`, which uses the `import.meta` feature added in ES2020 (don't worry about browser support though, Vite replaces all `import.meta.env` mentions with static values). For example, to get the `PUBLIC_POKEAPI` environment variable, you could use `import.meta.env.PUBLIC_POKEAPI`.

```js
fetch(`${import.meta.env.PUBLIC_POKEAPI}/pokemon/squirtle`);
```

> ⚠️WARNING⚠️:
> Because Vite statically replaces `import.meta.env`, you cannot access it with dynamic keys like `import.meta.env[key]`.

## IntelliSense for TypeScript

By default, Vite provides type definition for `import.meta.env` in `vite/client.d.ts`. While you can define more custom env variables in `.env.[mode]` files, you may want to get TypeScript IntelliSense for user-defined env variables which prefixed with `PUBLIC_`.

To achieve, you can create an `env.d.ts` in `src` directory, then augment `ImportMetaEnv` like this:

```ts
interface ImportMetaEnv {
  readonly PUBLIC_POKEAPI: string;
  // more env variables...
}

interface ImportMeta {
  readonly env: ImportMetaEnv;
}
```
