```shell
# prerequisite: check that Node.js is 14.15.0+, or 16+
node --version

# Make a new project directory, and navigate directly into it
mkdir my-astro-project && cd $_

# prepare for liftoff...
npm init astro

# install dependencies
npm install

# start developing!
npm run dev
```

For production sites,

```shell
# when you're ready: build your static site to `dist/`
npm run build
```

To learn more about installing and using Astro for the first time, please [read our installation guide.](/en/installation)

If you prefer to learn by example, check out our [complete library of examples](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/examples) on GitHub. You can check out any of these examples locally by running `npm init astro -- --template "EXAMPLE_NAME"`.

## Start your project

From inside your project directory, enter the following command into your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Astro will now start serving your application on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Opening this URL in your browser, you should see the Astro's "Hello, World".

The server will listen for live file changes in your `src/` directory, so you do not need to restart the application as you make changes during development.

## Build your project

To build your project, from inside your directory enter the following build command into your terminal:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will instruct Astro to build your site and save it directly to disk. Your application is now ready in the `dist/` directory.

## Deploy your project

Astro sites are static, so they can be deployed to your favourite host:

- [AWS S3 bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
- [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Read more about deploying Astro in our Deploy guide.](/en/guides/deploy)
