**Astro** is a _fresh but familiar_ approach to building websites. Astro combines decades of proven performance best practices with the DX improvements of the component-oriented era. Use your favorite JavaScript framework and automatically ship the bare-minimum amount of JavaScript—by default.

## Project Status

⚠️ **Astro is still an early beta, missing features and bugs are to be expected!** If you can stomach it, then Astro-built sites are production ready and several production websites built with Astro already exist in the wild. We will update this note once we get closer to a stable, v1.0 release.

## Quick Start

```bash
# get started with astro in 3 easy steps:
mkdir new-project-directory
cd new-project-directory
npm init astro
```
